          <p>Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.

An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. If you ever have a question like, "What happens if I add an int to a list?" Just typing it into the Python interpreter is a fast and likely the best way to see what happens.</p>

          <p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.

For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.

To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>

          <article>
            <p>Like C++ and Java, Python is case sensitive so "a" and "A" are different variables. The end of a line marks the end of a statement, so unlike C++ and Java, Python does not require a semicolon at the end of each statement. Comments begin with a '#' and extend to the end of the line.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python source files use the ".py" extension and are called "modules."</li>
          <li>With a Python module hello.py, the easiest way to run it is with the shell command "python hello.py Alice" which calls the Python interpreter to execute the code in hello.py, passing it the command line argument "Alice". </li>
        </ul>
        <code>#!/usr/bin/env python

# import modules used here -- sys is a very standard one
import sys

# Gather our code in a main() function
def main():
    print('Hello there', sys.argv[1])
    # Command line args are in sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2] ...
    # sys.argv[0] is the script name itself and can be ignored

# Standard boilerplate to call the main() function to begin
# the program.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</code>

          <article>
            <p>Functions in Python are defined like this:</p>
            <code># Defines a "repeat" function that takes 2 arguments.
def repeat(s, exclaim):
    """
    Returns the string 's' repeated 3 times.
    If exclaim is true, add exclamation marks.
    """

    result = s + s + s # can also use "s * 3" which is faster (Why?)
    if exclaim:
        result = result + '!!!'
    return result</code>
    <p>Notice also how the lines that make up the function or if-statement are grouped by all having the same level of indentation. We also presented 2 different ways to repeat strings, using the + operator which is more user-friendly, but * also works because it's Python's "repeat" operator, meaning that '-' * 10 gives '----------', a neat way to create an onscreen "line." In the code comment, we hinted that * works faster than +, the reason being that * calculates the size of the resulting object once whereas with +, that calculation is made each time + is called. Both + and * are called "overloaded" operators because they mean different things for numbers vs. for strings (and other data types).</p>
    <p>The def keyword defines the function with its parameters within parentheses and its code indented. The first line of a function can be a documentation string ("docstring") that describes what the function does. The docstring can be a single line, or a multi-line description as in the example above. (Yes, those are "triple quotes," a feature unique to Python!) Variables defined in the function are local to that function, so the "result" in the above function is separate from a "result" variable in another function. The return statement can take an argument, in which case that is the value returned to the caller.</p>
    <p>Here is code that calls the above repeat() function, printing what it returns:</p>
    <code>def main():
    print(repeat('Yay', False))      ## YayYayYay
    print(repeat('Woo Hoo', True))   ## Woo HooWoo HooWoo Hoo!!!</code>

            <p>One unusual Python feature is that the whitespace indentation of a piece of code affects its meaning. A logical block of statements such as the ones that make up a function should all have the same indentation, set in from the indentation of their parent function or "if" or whatever. If one of the lines in a group has a different indentation, it is flagged as a syntax error.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python's use of whitespace feels a little strange at first, but it's logical and I found I got used to it very quickly. Avoid using TABs as they greatly complicate the indentation scheme (not to mention TABs may mean different things on different platforms). Set your editor to insert spaces instead of TABs for Python code.</li>
               <li>A common question beginners ask is, "How many spaces should I indent?" According to the official Python style guide (PEP 8), you should indent with 4 spaces. (Fun fact: Google's internal style guideline dictates indenting by 2 spaces!)</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            Python does very little checking at compile time, deferring almost all type, name, etc. checks on each line until that line runs. Suppose the above main() calls repeat() like this:
          </p>
          <code>def main():
    if name == 'Guido':
        print(repeeeet(name) + '!!!')
    else:
        print(repeat(name))</code>
        <p>The if-statement contains an obvious error, where the repeat() function is accidentally typed in as repeeeet(). The funny thing in Python ... this code compiles and runs fine so long as the name at runtime is not 'Guido'. Only when a run actually tries to execute the repeeeet() will it notice that there is no such function and raise an error. There is also a second error in this snippet. name wasn't assigned a value before it is compared with 'Guido'. Python will raise a 'NameError' if you try to evaluate an unassigned variable. These are some examples demonstrating that when you first run a Python program, some of the first errors you see will be simple typos or uninitialized variables like these. This is one area where languages with a more verbose type system, like Java, have an advantage ... they can catch such errors at compile time (but of course you have to maintain all that type information ... it's a tradeoff).</p>

            <p>There are a variety of ways to get help for Python.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do a Google search, starting with the word "python", like "python list" or "python string lowercase". The first hit is often the answer. This technique seems to work better for Python than it does for other languages for some reason.</li>
              <li>The official Python docs site — docs.python.org — has high quality docs. Nonetheless, I often find a Google search of a couple words to be quicker.</li>
              <li>There is also an official Tutor mailing list specifically designed for those who are new to Python and/or programming!</li>
              <li>Many questions (and answers) can be found on StackOverflow and Quora.</li>
              <li>
                Use the help() and dir() functions.
              </li>
